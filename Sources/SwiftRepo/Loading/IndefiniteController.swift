/// A state machine for indefinite processes, in particular indefinite loading.

/// Indefinite loading is a UX refinement that brings the following logic to loading states:
/// 1. If the data loads faster than some specified `delay`, the data will be displayed, bypassing the loading state.
/// 2. If the data loads slower than `delay`, the loading state will be displayed for a guaranteed `minimumDuration`.
///
/// The user calls `start()` before initiating the indefinite process, e.g. before loading content. If the controller transitions
/// to delaying state, i.e. the time is less than `delay`, the user should hide the loading state.
///
/// When the indefinite process is finished, e.g. the content is downloaded, the
/// user waits for the indefinite controller to finish by awaiting `stop()`. If the time is less than `delay`, `stop()`
/// will complete immediately. If the time is greater than `delay`, `stop()` will complete as soon as the time is
/// greater than `delay + minimumDuration`.
///
/// When `stop()` is completed, the user may transition away from the loading state.
